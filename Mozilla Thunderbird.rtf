\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\fs28 Mozilla Thunderbird is a free and open-source,[11] cross-platform email client, news client, RSS, and chat client developed by the Mozilla Foundation. The project strategy was modeled after that of the Mozilla Firefox web browser. It is installed by default on Ubuntu desktop systems.\par
\ul\fs40 HISTORY\ulnone\fs28\par
Originally launched as Minotaur shortly after Phoenix (the original name for Mozilla Firefox), the project failed to gain momentum. With the success of the latter, however, demand increased for a mail client to go with it, and the work on Minotaur was revived under the new name of Thunderbird, and migrated to the new toolkit developed by the Firefox team.\par
\ul\fs40 CODING\ulnone\fs28\par
The Insert menu provides the ability to include HTML code. Thus, one can insert subscripts with <sub> and </sub>, the degree symbol \'b0 with \'b0, etc., into a message being composed.\par
\ul\fs40 RELEASES\ulnone\fs28\par
Thunderbird development releases occur in three stages, called Beta, Earlybird, and Daily, which correspond to Firefox's Beta, Aurora, and Nightly stages. The release dates and Gecko versions are exactly the same as Firefox; for example, Firefox 7 and Thunderbird 7 were both released on September 27, 2011, and were both based on Gecko 7.0\par
\ul\fs40 INTERNATIONALIZATION AND LOCALISATION\ulnone\fs28\par
With contributors all over the world, the client is translated into more than 50 different languages, although email addresses are currently limited to ASCII local parts.[35] Thunderbird does not yet support SMTPUTF8 (RFC 6531) or Email Address Internationalization.\fs52\par
\ul\fs40 POINTS\ulnone\fs28\par
1)Thunderbird has a subsystem called Gloda. Gloda stands for \'ab Global Database \'bb, and creates Thunderbird-wide relations between objects. Gloda provides concepts such as Conversations, Messages, Identities, Contacts. All these concepts are related : a Conversation contains Messages which are linked to Identities (from field, to field) which are themselves part of a Contact: indeed, a contact has multiple identities.\par
2)Mozilla Thunderbird does not need a new email ID, user can use through their existing ID and user doesnt login through thier ID as it justs adds their account\par
3)Instead of using webmail sites like hotmail,gmail,yahoo user can use mozilla thunderbird because if a user uses one of the webmail sites user have to specific rules acccording to the respective websites but if a user uses mozilla Thunderbird they can just their respective account.\par
4)User can set various events, tasks, also set their chat account, have their address book along with sending and receiving mails.\par
\ul\fs40 BUGS\ulnone\fs28\par
1)Malfunction when deleting a message opened in a tab or stand-alone window.\fs52\par
\fs28 2)Customising From address breaks saving draft and sending message.\fs22\par
