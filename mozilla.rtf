\fs32 The project began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by Dave Hyatt, Joe Hewitt, and Blake Ross \par
\fs40  IDEA \par
\fs32 Mozilla Firefox, or simply Firefox, is a free and opensource[24] web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation. Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, macOS and Linux; its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD,[9]OpenBSD,[10] NetBSD,[11] illumos[12 ] and Solaris Unix.[14] Its sibling, Firefox for Android, is also available. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.[25] In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.[26] An additional version, Firefox for iOS, was released on November 12, 2015. Due to platform restrictions, it uses the WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko, as with all other iOS web browsers. It is the fastest web browser in the world[ \par
\fs22  \fs40 PROBLEMS IT SOLVE\fs22\par
\fs32  Firefox is a Web browser that is smaller, faster, and in some ways more secure than the Mozilla browser from which much of its code was originally derived. Compared to Internet Explorer, the most popular Web \par
browser, Firefox gives users a cleaner interface and faster download speeds \par
\fs40  LICENSING MODEL \fs22\par
\fs32 The current version of the license is MPL 2.0 \par
\fs40  HOW DOES IT EARNS MONEY \par
\fs32  The simple answer is the same as Mozilla Firefox. Google receives money from advertisers but, instead of paying out search royalties to other browsers, the moneyis transferred to the Chrome part of Google. Simply put, Chrome makes money by saving Google royalty expenses. \fs22\par
